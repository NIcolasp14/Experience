# Learning Experience
### Education
#### Oct 2018 - (Sept 2023), National Technical University of Athens
B.Eng. & M.Eng. Electrical and Computer Engineering  
Specialising in Computer Science (ML, DL, Algo, Softeng), Bioinformatics, Management  

#### Oct 2017 - Sept 2018, National Kapodistrian University of Athens
Studied Physics for one year at NKUA, before I decided to pursue Electrical and Computer Engineering at NTUA. During this year, apart from the courses’ value, I got to know the critical and theoretical thinking of a physicist, as well as the 'First Principle' reasoning.

### Volunteering
Nov 2018 - May 2019: IEEE Student Branch NTUA, RAS (Robotic Automation Society). Would come back as a team leader if it wasn’t for COVID-19.  
Sept 2014 - June 2016: Teaching computer lessons for free to young Congolese teens. (Windows OS familiarisation, basics of coding, MS Office)  
May 2010 - June 2016: Providing necessities to poverty-stricken regions in Lubumbashi, mainly to families and children. Was tied to a big family, spent quality time and provided guidance to the children.
